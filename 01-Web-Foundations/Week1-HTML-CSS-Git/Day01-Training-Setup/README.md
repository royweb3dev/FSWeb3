# Day 01: Traning Setup & Git Discipline

## Objectives

- Install and configure essential tools: VS Code, Git.
- Understand and practice the basic Git cycle (`init`, `add`, `commit`).
- Initialize the Training project directory with a standard structure.
- Apply Conventional Commits as the standard for writing commit messages.
- Connect the local repository to a GitHub account.

## Key Learnings

Today focused on establishing a solid foundation. The main concept was Version Control with Git. I learned that `git add` is used to stage changes, effectively selecting what goes into the next "snapshot," while `git commit` is the action of creating that permanent snapshot with a descriptive message. The Conventional Commits standard (`type(scope): message`) was introduced to enforce a clean and readable commit history.

## Outputs & Proof of Work

1.  **Repository Initialization:**

    - **Commit:** `feat: initial commit - project setup and gitignore`
    - **Link:** [https://github.com/royweb3dev/FSWeb3/commit/914c679a973a21643c1cd50cd982a7a44f9ba6cc](https://github.com/royweb3dev/FSWeb3/commit/914c679a973a21643c1cd50cd982a7a44f9ba6cc)

2.  **Directory Scaffolding:**
    - **Commit:** `feat(project): scaffold complete directory structure based on roadmap`
    - **Link:** [https://github.com/royweb3dev/FSWeb3/commit/ddf789d2d887a2d1d57f07a7e37138093c12660a](https://github.com/royweb3dev/FSWeb3/commit/ddf789d2d887a2d1d57f07a7e37138093c12660a)

## Next Steps

- Move on to Day 02: HTML Structure and Semantics.
