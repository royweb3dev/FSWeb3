# Day 08 – Flexbox Deep Dive

Today was all about mastering Flexbox — not just the basics, but how to use it to build clean, responsive layouts that actually scale. The goal wasn’t to memorize properties, but to build layout muscle memory.

## ✅ What I Built

I implemented a **Core Competencies** section using Flexbox. It features three responsive cards:

- **Frontend & UX** – Clean interfaces, performance-focused.
- **Smart Contracts** – On-chain logic and testing.
- **Backend & DevOps** – Infrastructure and CI/CD readiness.

Each card was built using nested flex containers and a flexible sizing strategy with `flex: 1` and `min-width`. I also added interaction polish with hover effects and used modern spacing via `gap` instead of outdated margin hacks.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

| Topic                   | What I Focused On                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flex Containers & Items | Setting up main and cross axis flow with `display: flex`.      |
| Justify & Align         | Practicing `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `align-self`. |
| Flex-Wrap               | Making the layout responsive without media queries.            |
| Gap vs Margin           | Using `gap` for clean spacing between elements.                |
| Flex Grow/Shrink/Basis  | Controlling item proportions inside containers.                |
| Nested Flex             | Creating vertical card content flow with flex-inside-flex.     |
| Common Pitfalls Avoided | No overnesting, no fixed heights, no collapsing margins.       |

## 🔍 Reflection

Flexbox isn’t magic, but it is incredibly powerful once it “clicks.” The biggest takeaway today: always think in axes — and let the layout breathe. Hardcoding dimensions is a trap. Flexbox lets the browser do the heavy lifting.

## 📁 Files Updated

- `index.html` → Added the Core Competencies section.
- `styles.css` → Modular styles for `.features-container` and `.feature-card`.
